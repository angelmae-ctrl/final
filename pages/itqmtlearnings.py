I've gained a lot of practical experience using various programming tools and methods in this subject.
I've used Google Colab a lot to write and run many codes for data analysis and visualization. I also made a Streamlit app, using my programming skills to create interactive and easy-to-use applications. These projects have really helped me understand quantitative methods and programming, so I can analyze and explain data clearly and accurately.
Also, these practical projects have deepened my understanding of what these tools can do and what they can't do in real-life situations. Using Google Colab improved my coding skills and showed me how to work with others .
Creating the Streamlit app taught me how to design simple screens and connect them with the back-end, so I can make complex data easy for users to understand.
In short, these experiences have been very important for improving how I think about problems and how I solve them, giving me the skills to handle many different challenges in jobs that use a lot of data.
